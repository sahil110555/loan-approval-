 The **Loan Approval Prediction** project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved by a bank. This prediction is made by analyzing various factors and information provided by the applicant. The project involves assessing variables such as loan amount, tenure, CIBIL score, education, assets, and other relevant features.
